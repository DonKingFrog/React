                    <p>If you've been living under a rock, Roblox has released a new Ban API with many capabilities ordinary scripts developed by Roblox developers can't manage with the given environment. These include the detection of alternative accounts (alts) and giving us the ability to use these API outside Roblox without requiring a running server. This feature was released shortly after the final phase of Nexus Dynamic's development; Therefore, we didn't have time to implement this system.</p>

                    <p>This has been our most requested feature for Nexus Dynamics and has gone through decision making to implement. We're still a little skeptical at the time of this post but we've been keeping an eye on recent reports that fully utilize this new system without any problems. Therefore, we've decided to implement this into Nexus Dynamics v2.0.5.</p>
                    <br />
                    <p>The new system will now give all developers the capability of managing Nexus Dynamics bans outside of the game and still be able to configure them in-game! In addition to this, we won't be wasting valuable memory on DataStoreService, assisting people that use global leaderboards with Nexus Dynamics in their experience.</p>
